## Docker vs Virtual Machine
Docker runs on containers, which are like a virtual machine in a sense that they both take "images" (snapshot of your current computer environment) and upload it so that it can be shared with other people. The difference is that VMs take a snapshot of your entire OS and its resources, whereas containers are just snapshot of running processes.
