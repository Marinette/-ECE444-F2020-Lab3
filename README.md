| Follow a model called "relational databases", which stores data in tables. Tables contain a column called the primary key, a unique identifier for each row. Different tables are linked together using a column containing foreign keys (keys that reference primary keys of another table).The linkage between tables form what is known as a "relationship" in relational databases | Do not follow the relational model. They use collections, instead of tables. Relationships are generally not drawn between different collections. All keys and their values are stored in a collection. |
